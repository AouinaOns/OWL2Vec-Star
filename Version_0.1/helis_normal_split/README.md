train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv: training, validating and testing axioms from the original ontology helis.v1.00.origin.owl.

helis_v1.00.train.owl: ontology after training axioms are removed

helis_v1.00.train.projection.ttl: the projection of helis_v1.00.train.owl

classes.txt: all named classes

individuals.txt: all named individuals

annotations.txt: annotation axioms

axioms.txt: all normal declared axioms

axioms_hermit.txt: all normal axioms and those inferred

inferred_classes.txt: all inferred classes of each testing individual except for its ground truth

annotations.txt, axioms.txt, axioms_hermit.txt are generated by Ontology_Axioms_Annotations.java

herlis_v1.00.train.projection.ttl is generated by Ontology_Projector.java

train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv, classes.txt, individuals and inferred_classes.txt are generated by ClassAssertion_NormalSplit.java

For TransR/DistMult/TransE, please train the embeddings by OpenKE, and use the learned embedding file in Baselines.py. 

For Quantum Embedding, please train the embeddings by its own codes or use the embeddings by us under qembeddings-27000iters (simply run Quantum_Run.sh)
