train.csv/valid.csv/test.csv: training, validating and testing axioms from the original ontology foodon-merged.owl

go.train.owl: ontology after training axioms are removed
go.train.projection.ttl: the projection of go.train.owl

classes.txt: all named classes
annotations.txt: annotation axioms
axioms.txt: all normal declared axioms
axioms_hermit.txt: all normal axioms and those inferred
inferred_ancestors.txt: all inferred ancestors of each testing class except for its ground truth

annotations.txt, axioms.txt, axioms_hermit.txt are generated by Ontology_Axioms_Annotations.java
foodon-merged.train.projection.ttl is generated by Ontology_Projector.java
train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv, classes.txt, and inferred_ancestors.txt are generated by SubClass_NormalSplit.java

For TransR/DistMult/TransE, please train the embeddings by OpenKE, and use the learned embedding file in Baselines.py. 
For EL Embedding, please train the embeddings by its own codes (https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/el-embeddings), and use the learned embedding file in Baselines.py
