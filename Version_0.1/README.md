This folder includes the codes and data to re-run the membership and subsumption prediction experiments in our paper "OWL2Vec\*: Embedding OWL Ontologies".

Our python codes in this package are tested with
1. Python 3.7
2. RDFLib 4.2.2
3. gensim 3.8.0
4. scikit-learn 0.21.2
5. nltk 3.5

Please refer to helis_normal_split/README.md for membership prediciton on HeLis, refer to foodon_normal_split/README.md for subsumption prediction on FoodOn, and refer to go_normal_split/README.md for subsumption prediction on GO.

Acknowledgements
For random walk and WL subtree kernel, we re-use the codes of pyRDF2Vec.
