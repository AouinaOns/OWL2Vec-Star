This folder includes the codes and data to re-run the membership and subsumption prediction experiments in our paper ***"OWL2Vec\*: Embedding OWL Ontologies"***.

Please refer to the corresponding folder for each task:
1. helis_normal_split/README.md for membership prediciton on HeLis
2. refer to foodon_normal_split/README.md for subsumption prediction on FoodOn
3. refer to go_normal_split/README.md for subsumption prediction on GO.

The ontologies are in data.tar.gz.
