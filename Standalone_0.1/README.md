Our codes in this package are tested with
1. Python 3.7
2. RDFLib 4.2.2
3. gensim 3.8.0
4. scikit-learn 0.21.2
5. nltk 3.5
6. OWLready 0.25

The standalone application is ready now: OWL2Vec\_Standalone.py
It can be configured by the configuration file default.cfg
Example: python --config\_file default.cfg

The standalone can support OWL2Vec\*, as well as its variants such as OWL2Vec, Onto2Vec and OPA2Vec. We will soon make a document for start up. You can now see comments in the program and default.cfg to learn more.
