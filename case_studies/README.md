Here are the instructions for reproducing the results of class membership/subsumption prediction on HeLis/FoodOn/GO. 

- Unzip files.tar.gz for files by pre-processing.

  1. train.csv, valid.csv and test.csv: training, validation and testing axioms extracted from the original ontology (in ontologies.tar.gz).
  2. xx.train.owl: the ontology after the validation and testing axioms are removed.
  3. xx.train.projection.ttl: the projection of xx.train.owl.
  4. classes.txt, individuals.txt: all named classes and individuals (case studies on FoodOn and GO have no individuals.txt).
  5. annotations.txt, axioms.txt: annotations and declared axioms of xx.train.owl.
  6. axioms_hermit.txt: all declared axioms plus axioms inferred by HermiT from xx.train.owl.
  7. inferred_classes.txt: all inferred classes of each testing individual/class except for its ground truth (which is the declared class/super-class to predict).
  
  8. The pre-processing can be implemented by OWL JAVA API-based programmes under **case\_studies/java/**: annotations.txt, axioms.txt, axioms_hermit.txt are generated by Ontology_Axioms_Annotations.java; 
  herlis_v1.00.train.projection.ttl is generated by Ontology_Projector.java;
  train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv, classes.txt, individuals and inferred_classes.txt are generated by ClassAssertion_NormalSplit.java.

- To reproduce OWL2Vec Star results, run ```python OWL2Vec_Plus.py```
    1. See examples with different settings in OWL2Vec_Plus_Run.sh

- To reproduce a *baseline* (e.g., RDF2Vec), run ```python Baselines.py```

   1. See examples with different settings in *Baseline*_Run.sh (e.g., RDF2Vec_Run.sh)

   2. For TransR/DistMult/TransE, please train the embeddings by OpenKE, and set the learned embedding file in Baselines.py. 

   3. For Quantum Embedding, please train the embeddings by its [codes](https://github.com/IBM/e2r/tree/master/neurips2019) or use the embeddings trained by us under qembeddings-27000iters, and then run Quantum_Run.
   
   4. For EL Embedding, please train the embeddings by its own [codes](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/el-embeddings), and set the learned embedding file in Baselines.py.
