#### unzip files.tar.gz for I/O files

1. train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv: training, validating and testing axioms from the original ontology foodon-merged.owl
2. go.train.owl: ontology after training axioms are removed
3. go.train.projection.ttl: the projection of go.train.owl
4. classes.txt: all named classes
5. annotations.txt, axioms.txt: annotation axioms and all normal declared axioms of go.train.owl respectively
6. axioms_hermit.txt: all normal axioms and those inferred of go.train.owl
7. inferred_ancestors.txt: all inferred ancestors of each class except for its ground truth (declared parent class)
8. annotations.txt, axioms.txt, axioms_hermit.txt are generated by Ontology_Axioms_Annotations.java; foodon-merged.train.projection.ttl is generated by Ontology_Projector.java; train.csv, valid.csv, test.csv, classes.txt, and inferred_ancestors.txt are generated by SubClass_NormalSplit.java

#### For TransR/DistMult/TransE, please train the embeddings by OpenKE, and set the learned embedding file in Baselines.py. 

#### For EL Embedding, please train the embeddings by its own [codes](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/el-embeddings), and set the learned embedding file in Baselines.py
